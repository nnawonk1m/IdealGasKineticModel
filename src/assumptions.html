    <div class="caption"><p>Kinetic Model of an Ideal gas involves utilizing statistical models - in this case, concepts such as averaging and mean values - to analyze data and draw relevant conclusions. In the process, macroscopic porperties such as pressure will be considered based on molecular movement.</p></div>

    <div class="sub-heading"><h3>The following are the 8 Key Assumptions behind the Kinetic Model:</h3></div>

    <div class="caption">
      <ol>
        <li>Gases consist of a large number of tiny particles called molecules</li>
        <li>The numer of molecules is large enough to make statistical averages</li>
        <li>The volume of each molecule is negligible when compared to the volume of the gas as a whole</li>
        <li>The duration of collision is negligible when compared to the interval between the collisions</li>
        <li>The collision between the molecules and the collision between the molecules and the container walls are perfectly elastic collisions</li>
        <li>There are no intermolecular forces between the molecules, so the internal energy of the gas is entirely kinetic</li>
        <li>The molecules are in constant random motion and direction</li>
        <li>Each molecule produces force against the wall, and the forces averages out as pressure</li>
